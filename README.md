# Documentation for git

This is a collection of tips and tricks that I gathered for my personal usage. However, they might be of interest to others, thus, I decided to share them.

Originally, it could be found on the wiki pages of another of my repos (specifically, [here](https://github.com/bilbopingouin/linux-cfg/wiki/Git)).

Get started [here](docs/Git.md).
